# Unicorns UI Template

Just another template to rapidly build a component library. Ideal for beginners.

## Get Started From Scratch

1. Create a new package (`package.json`) and fill in the blanks through the prompts.

   ```bash
   npm init
   ```

1. Choose a [license](choosealicense.com) and add it to your `LICENSE` in your repo.

1. [.gitignore](.gitignore): hides things from Git so that it is only available to you.
   It works well to ignore things like personal settings, auto-generated content,
   sensitive data like auth keys & environment settings etc, and large files that can be shared some place else.

   ```bash
   touch .gitignore
   ```
